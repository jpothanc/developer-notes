I hope N and S have gotten back to you regarding the dates and availability to get started.

I wanted to share a thought that’s been on my mind. 

As you know, I’ve been leading teams since 2006, and with my seniority and experience, I believe it would be most effective if I could report directly to you. This would not only give me a great sense of confidence and motivation but also align well with my commitment to delivering results.

Please rest assured that I will dedicate my best efforts to ensuring things are done efficiently and effectively.

I can confidently say that the UBS behavioral themes—“Accountability with Integrity, Collaboration with Innovation”—resonate deeply with me and reflect how I approach my work.

On a related note, your comment about the APAC UAT environment issues and delayed
response struct a thread in me.

Last week I spend developing a web soluton to monitor and manage the applications remotely hosted on linux machines. I can even fire up this portal on my mobile, to view health checks, start and stop service and many more.
