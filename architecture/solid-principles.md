# Solid Principles

Solid principles refer to a set of guidelines for object-oriented programming (OOP) and software design. The acronym SOLID was introduced by Robert C. Martin and stands for:

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or single purpose.

2. O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing for new functionality without modifying existing code.

3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes, ensuring that inheritance maintains the correctness of the program.

4. I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use, promoting smaller, more focused interfaces.

5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions, reducing coupling and increasing flexibility.

These principles aim to promote maintainable, flexible, and scalable software design. Do you have any specific questions about these principles or how to apply them?
