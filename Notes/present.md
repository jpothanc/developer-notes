Hello team, Good evening.

My name is Jessish, and I used to be the technical and delivery lead for APAC front office applications. Anup is my colleague, and I have known him for years. I'm glad to be here to present Anup's candidacy for a director-level promotion.

Anup has been with CS for the last 15 years. Throughout his career at the bank, he has been associated with the Program Ttrading platform in various capacities.

He began his career at Credit Suisse as a Program Trading developer in Singapore, working on both the GUI and backend services.

Seizing an opportunity, he relocated to Tokyo, where he spent nearly two years supporting the Algo and Program Trading platform. In Tokyo, he worked closely with the Program Ttrading desk, handling release management and support. Additionally, he collaborated with the compliance team to onboard Algo strategies for the Japanese market.

He then relocated to Hong Kong, working exclusively on the Program Trading desk. In this role, he tackled various business initiatives, eliminated numerous process inefficiencies, and provided crucial support for the PT desk. He was also given the responsibility of onboarding Delta 1 traders to the PT platform. Post-onboarding, he also worked on various consolidations of infrastructure which saved costs.

After a year, Anup returned to Singapore to rejoin the Program Trading team.

When the Program Trading lead relocated to the US in 2018, Anup stepped in and ensured that business operations continued seamlessly, without any disruptions.

As the lead, he maintained close working relationships with Desk Heads and Traders to ensure smooth operations. He chaired biweekly sprint planning meetings with business, to align business objectives and streamline decision-making processes. He fulfilled business commitments, provided regular updates to the business, and gradually earned trust from the desk.

Let me highlight a few of his recent initiatives:

In the NJA market, the PT desk required an extra hop for executing baskets, primarily due to the absence of various market regulations within the PT platform. Leveraging his extensive knowledge, Anup proposed necessary changes, documented the details meticulously, and developed a comprehensive project plan. He took full ownership of the project, developed solutions, and went live for the Australian market. However, that is when we had to stop the work due to the UBS takeover.

The HKID project posed significant challenges for the PT team due to the complexities of the workflow. Drawing on his deep expertise again, Anup diligently documented all use cases, including corner cases. He clarified ambiguities with the desk and diligently oversaw the project from inception to completion, ensuring its success.

Under his watch, legacy applications like Piranha, Fast Booker, and Risk Trader were decommissioned, which achieved substantial cost reductions and brought operational efficiencies.

He helped to rewrite the application called Fast Booker with a microservice-based solution with fully automated tests. This initiative resolved longstanding teething issues that had persisted for years.

The Desktop Strategy was a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the trader desktops. As part of this program, all applications on the traders' desktops were supposed to communicate with each other, sharing context seamlessly. Anup played a crucial role in this transformation by partnering with the Market Intelligence team to develop and implement this communication framework.

He also resolved teething issues which lingered for years like the Fill Proportion algorithm during high volume days.

He keeps a close eye on the EOL (End of Life) infrastructure and ensures it is addressed promptly.

To conclude, Anup has shown deep commitment and loyalty to the bank and his responsibilities. His extensive experience in various capacities, his leadership and team management skills, engineering skills, ability to drive innovation through strategic initiatives, and above all his pleasing, pragmatic, and collaborative personality make him an ideal candidate for the director promotion.

Thank you. Hope I did some justice in presenting Anupâ€™s qualifications and achievements. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your support.

I wholeheartedly agree that Anup has been in his current role for many years and truly deserved a promotion after taking on the lead role of the PT team. Unfortunately, the frequent management changes since 2018 have delayed this progression. We have experienced at least four management shifts that have jeopardized his prospects due to a lack of support and premature decisions to transform team structures and other organizational elements.

Engineering Culture
Proactively shares his expertise and conducts training sessions with broader teams. He meticulously documents every detail, ensuring that all information is accessible to the team. Passionate about working on the latest initiatives, he actively seeks to transform outdated legacy systems. Recognized as a domain expert, his colleagues consistently seek his valuable insights and expertise, valuing his contributions and guidance. Promotes DevOps culture.

Agile:
Champions Agile methodologies by conducting Scrum meetings with business teams and fulfilling the role of Scrum Master, ensuring that development processes remain agile and team-oriented.
