# Azure Cost Management

Azure shifts development costs from capital expenses (CapEx) for infrastructure to operational expenses (OpEx) by renting infrastructure. The OpEx costs are impacted by multiple factors which include:

| Cost Factor           | Description                                                | Impact Details                                                                                          | Examples                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resource Type**     | The specific Azure services used (VMs, storage, etc.).     | Costs vary based on the type and settings of each resource, as well as the region they are deployed in. | - VM pricing varies by size, region, and OS.<br>- Storage accounts differ in cost based on access tiers and redundancy options. |
| **Consumption**       | The amount of resources consumed.                          | Pay-as-you-go pricing model, with optional reserved capacity for discounts.                             | - Higher compute usage increases costs.<br>- Reserved instances provide up to 72% discount.                                     |
| **Maintenance**       | Management of Azure resources.                             | Proper resource management can prevent unnecessary costs from idle or unoptimized resources.            | - Regularly reviewing and shutting down unused VMs can reduce costs.                                                            |
| **Geography**         | The region where resources are deployed.                   | Costs vary due to regional differences in electricity, labor, taxes, and data transfer fees.            | - Deploying services in regions with lower costs.<br>- Data transfer costs are lower when kept within the same region.          |
| **Subscription Type** | The type of Azure subscription used.                       | Different subscriptions can include various pricing structures and discounts.                           | - Azure Free accounts offer limited free resources.<br>- Enterprise agreements may include different cost structures.           |
| **Azure Marketplace** | Third-party services and products purchased through Azure. | Costs include Azure services and third-party vendor charges.                                            | - Purchasing pre-configured VMs or specialized services from third-party vendors.                                               |
| **Network Traffic**   | Data transfer volumes and locations.                       | Costs associated with data moving in and out of Azure datacenters, especially across regions.           | - Inbound data to Azure is generally free, but outbound data incurs charges based on the amount and destination.                |

### Resource Type

- Each Azure resource type (VMs, storage accounts, etc.) has specific pricing based on:
  - Resource settings
  - Azure region
- Example: Cost differences in storage accounts based on type, performance tier, access tier, redundancy settings, and region.

### Consumption

- **Pay-as-you-go**: Costs directly tied to resource usage.
- **Reserved Instances**: Offers discounts up to 72% for committing to certain resource usage for a period (usually 1-3 years).

### Maintenance

- Efficient resource management helps control costs, such as ensuring that unnecessary resources are not left running.

### Geography

- Costs vary by region due to differences in power, labor, taxes, and fees.
- Network traffic costs also vary, with different charges for data transfers between regions.

### Subscription Type

- Different subscription types may include usage allowances that affect costs.
- Example: Azure free trial includes certain free products and a credit for initial usage.

### Azure Marketplace

- Third-party solutions and services can also influence costs, with prices set by vendors.

## Tools for Cost Management

### Pricing and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculators

- **Pricing Calculator**: Estimates the cost of provisioning resources in Azure.
- **TCO Calculator**: Compares costs of on-premises infrastructure with Azure to estimate potential savings.

### Example Scenarios

- **Pricing Calculator Use**: Estimate costs for a basic web application using VMs, Application Gateway, and Azure SQL Database.
- **TCO Calculator Use**: Compare the costs of running existing on-premises workloads with Azure over three years, considering all associated costs.

## Additional Tools

### Cost Management

- Helps track and manage Azure resource costs.
- Features include cost analysis, budget alerts, and spending quotas.

### Tags

- Tags are metadata elements attached to resources to help with organization, cost management, operations, security, and compliance.
- Can be used to enforce policies and standards across resources.

## Key Points

- Costs in Azure are influenced by multiple factors including resource type, consumption patterns, and geographic location.
- Azure provides tools like cost calculators and cost management features to help users estimate and control their expenses effectively.
